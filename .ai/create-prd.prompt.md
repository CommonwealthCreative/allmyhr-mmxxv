# Rule: Generating a Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD) in Markdown format, based on an initial user prompt. The PRD should be clear, actionable, and suitable for a junior developer to understand and implement the feature.

## Process

1.  Receive Initial Prompt: The user provides a brief description or request for a new feature or functionality.
2.  Ask Clarifying Questions: Before writing the PRD, the AI must ask only the most essential clarifying questions needed to write a clear PRD. Limit questions to 3-5 critical gaps in understanding. The goal is to understand the "what" and "why" of the feature, not necessarily the "how" (which the developer will figure out). Make sure to provide options in letter/number lists so the user can respond easily with selections.
3.  Generate PRD: Based on the initial prompt and the user's answers to the clarifying questions, generate a PRD using the structure outlined below.
4.  Save PRD: Save the generated document as `prd-[feature-name].md` inside the `/tasks` directory.

## Clarifying Questions (Guidelines)

Ask only the most critical questions needed to write a clear PRD. Focus on areas where the initial prompt is ambiguous or missing essential context. Common areas that may need clarification:

- Problem/Goal: If unclear - "What problem does this feature solve for the user?"
- Core Functionality: If vague - "What are the key actions a user should be able to perform?"
- Scope/Boundaries: If broad - "Are there any specific things this feature should not do?"
- Success Criteria: If unstated - "How will we know when this feature is successfully implemented?"

Important: Only ask questions when the answer isn't reasonably inferable from the initial prompt. Prioritize questions that would significantly impact the PRD's clarity.

### Formatting Requirements

- Number all questions (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- List options for each question as A, B, C, D, etc.
- Make it simple for the user to respond with selections like "1A, 2C, 3B"

## PRD Structure

The generated PRD should include the following sections:

1.  Introduction/Overview
2.  Goals
3.  User Stories
4.  Functional Requirements (number these)
5.  Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
6.  Design Considerations (Optional)
7.  Technical Considerations (Optional)
8.  Success Metrics
9.  Open Questions

## Target Audience

Assume the primary reader of the PRD is a junior developer. Therefore, requirements should be explicit, unambiguous, and avoid jargon where possible.

## Output

- Format: Markdown (.md)
- Location: /tasks/
- Filename: prd-[feature-name].md

## Final instructions

1. Do NOT start implementing the PRD
2. Make sure to ask the user clarifying questions
3. Take the user's answers to the clarifying questions and improve the PRD
